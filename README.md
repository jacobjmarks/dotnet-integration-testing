## About The Project

This project is intended to consolidate the past lessons-learned and knowledge around integration testing applications under different contexts.
By having reference projects, new client engagements can be kick-started much more effectively by re-using applicable integration test setups in this repository.

The scope of reference examples to be created:
- A CRUD REST API with no external dependencies
- A CRUD REST API with an external API dependency
- A CRUD REST API involving the use of CosmosDB
- A CRUD REST API involving the use of Entity Framework
- A CRUD REST API involving the use of Azure SQL DB
- An Azure Function

Further work looks at the development of a framework (in the form of a NuGet package or otherwise) to make usage of the code easier.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Each solution targets a major version of .NET X.X individually, with minor differences made only to accomodate any breaking changes between the versions.
It is important to note that the focus is on testing -- the application itself only serves as practical example for how the testing setups should work.

### Prerequisites

(07/07/2023) TODO: Until the other examples involving external dependencies are setup,
there are no prerequisites to run this project, all you need to do is F5 and run.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage (TODO)

TODO: Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.
